## Introduction 

The ultimate goal of this analysis is to determine the underlying factors that led to the recent phenomenon being dubbed “The Great Resignation.” Our team decided on this topic after meeting for the first time. We decided that this topic was intriguing and applicable to the project, and the overall sentiment of each of us as individuals as we progressed through our careers. It seems that workplace cultures and the willingness to submit to old school working conditions has decreased over the recent years, our goal is to find out why. 

We believe that younger generations are placing more emphasis on work/life balance, compensation transparency, remote work, and company culture. Our goal for this project is to find, process, and use the data we can find to see what has caused this shift around working conditions and employment.

### Questions we Hope to Answer

- What are the contributing factors to individuals resigning from their jobs?
- Is there a correlation between age (retirement, etc.), job satisfaction, rate of pay, and resignation?
- What will future U.S. economic trends look like?
- What industries will be most impacted in the future by resignations?

### Communication Protocols 

Our team has determined that communication protocols will be as follows:

- Responsiveness and transparency are important, we have agreed that slack messages and updates will be provided as work is being done. 

- Sharing and collaboration are some of the more important aspects of getting this project done, in addition to our Github Repository, we have created a shared google drive. We believed that the google drive was a quicker way to share our resources and files as we progress through the project 

- We have agreed to at least two meeting times per week, with additional meetings being scheduled on a weekly basis determined by necessity and amount of work needed to be completed. It is likely this will be needed each week. Our group slack channel has been active on a daily basis with news and updates. We have thus far been meeting an extra 1-2x per week via zoom.

### Technologies Used

**Data Cleaning/ETL:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, CSV file, 

**Database:** SQL, Postgress

**Machine Learning:** Python, SKforecast

**Visualization and Presentation:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Google Slides

### Data Exploration

One of the biggest challenges we faced in week one was gathering usable data that supported the project. Before starting we were optimistic that there would be an abundance of data to choose from that would support our initial thoughts on the subject. We turned out to be wrong and realized that this part of our project would take more time than we had projected. Thankfully we discovered these datasets containing (describe).

### Challenges and Obstacles 

One of the biggest challenges we faced in week one was gathering usable data that supported the project. Before starting, we were optimistic that there would be an abundance of data to choose from that would support our initial thoughts on the subject. We turned out to be wrong, and realized that this part of our project will take more time than we had projected. We were confident that once we got the data we needed, the ETL process and steps thereafter would come along nicely.
