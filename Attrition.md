# Great_Resignation_Analysis

## Employee Attrition

Employee attrition measures how many workers are voluntarily or involuntary leaving their jobs for many reasons. During the Coivd 19 Pandemic, there was a mass exit in the workforce that is widely known as the Great Resignation. There are various contributing factors to the Great Resignation, but they can be broken down into five categories known as The Five R's.

<b>The Five R's:</b></br>
    -Retirement</br>
    -Relocation</br>
    -Reconsideration</br>
    -Reshuffling</br>
    -Reluctance</br>

<b>Retirement</b></br>
Many had the desire to spend more time with loved ones during an uncertain time and to focus on priorities outside of work.

<b>Relocation</b></br>
Some individuals moved from larger cities to smaller ones creating a change in lifestyle that was less stressful.

<b>Reconsideration</b></br>
Employees quit their jobs as their personal values no longer aligned with company culture. Companies may be focusing more on compensation when they should possibly be focusing on improving how their employees feel at work. Toxic work cultures are not conducive and employees seek a better work-life balance.

<b>Reshuffling</b></br>
Which then leads to a sudden shift in the workforce. Employees are searching for better wages, location, company workculture, and flexibility with work hours.

<b>Reluctance</b></br>
Workers are choosing remote work over an in office setting. Many are refusing to come into work full-time. There is time saved and cost savings in regards to commuting to and from work.
