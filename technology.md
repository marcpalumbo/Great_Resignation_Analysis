# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgress is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. To answer the question, "What industries will be affected in the future?", we will integrate plotly and geomapping.

## Dashboard
In addition to using Tableau, we will use matplotlib to formulate graphs and visualizations.

## Presentation
We will be putting our work together in a google slides presentation, and integrate some snippets of code, graphs, charts, and our tableau dashboard to tell our story.

*Future tools/technologies will be added as we progress throughout the project.*
