# Great_Resignation_Analysis

## Topic Selection

**The Great Resignation** is an ongoing economic trend in which employees have voluntarily resigned from their jobs en masse, beginning in early 2021 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For our project, we’re focusing on the U.S. workforce primarily in the manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, and education sector.

### Background

A little over a year after the COVID-19 pandemic began, economists and other observers took note of a rising job quit rate, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) program. JOLTS recorded a seasonally adjusted quit rate of 2.4 percent in the second month of the program’s existence (January 2001), and although this level was matched at other times, it was not surpassed until March 2021, when the quit rate reached 2.5 percent. This new record was quickly eclipsed in April 2021, when the quit rate stood at 2.8 percent; the current record is 3.0 percent, first reached in November 2021 and matched in December 2021. The rise in the quit rate has been called the “Great Resignation,” with many articles in the popular press speculating about why individuals have become more willing to leave their current employers. The fact that the labor force participation rate remains below its pre-pandemic high suggests that some of those who quit their jobs found new jobs and others exited the labor force.

## Reason for Topic Selection

We chose this topic as a group because it has affected everyone in the country in one way or another. COVID-19 changed the world, and certain things will never be the same. Employment rates plummeted, unemployment claims went through the roof, and in turn our economy has suffered a significant negative impact, and will likely continue to suffer for years to come. Understanding the contributing factors to the Great Resignation will enable us to understand our country and our people as a whole, and better predict future economic trends.

## Data Sources

We will be utilizing a few different data sets for this project. Some will be put through the entire ETL process, while some will only be utilized for machine learning.

## Questions we Hope to Answer

After analyzing our data and creating various visualizations, we hope to discover a correlation between geographic regions, contributing factors such as rate of pay, work commute, and education with rates of resignation among certain industries. We hope to predict future economic trends using our machine learning model, and clearly display these trends using graphs and charts in Tableau and MatPlotLib.
